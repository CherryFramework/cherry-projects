Showcase your projects using a variety of layouts with Cherry Projects plugin.

== Description ==

Cherry Projects is a portfolio management system that lets you create your projects and display them using a large number of options. Use ready-made templates for taking control over each element of your project.

Cherry Projects is a standalone plugin, however it depends on the Cherry Framework package that comes with the plugin by default. You don't need to download any additional modules manually, just be aware of this dependency.

= Display settings =

* Project listing layout. Choose from 5 different variations on how to display your project listing (grid, masonry, justified, cascading grid, and list).
* Pagination mode. If the number of portfolio items is larger than the maximum number of projects per page, the pagination will be applied. Pick the pagination mode you'd like to use from the available: ajax pagination, more button, or lazy load.
* Loading animation. Select which animation to use when the posts appear on the page during the loading.
* Hover animation. The animation used on hover for each portfolio item.

= Sorting & Filtering =

Choose whether to display filtering for your projects or not. If you choose to display it, there's a number of options.

* Filter type. Choose whether you want to display projects based on their categories, or tags.
* Filter order. You can also decide in which order to display your projects. Select the sorting order from ASC and DESC values, or output them based on the date of creation, name, last modified date or number of comments.
* Post format. Select which projects to output based on their post format. You can output all formats, or choose from standard, image, gallery, audio, or video formats.

= Additional Settings =

In addition there are three more settings you can adjust:

* Column number. Select the number of columns for masonry and grid project layouts.
* Posts per page. Choose the maximum number of post per page you want to showcase.
* Item margin. Adjust the margin size between separate portfolio items.

= Customizable Templates =

Cherry Projects is using a simplified templating system with .tmpl files. Out-of-the-box the plugin comes with templates for each of the project listing layouts and available post formats, which are used for displaying project single pages. Create the unique look and feel of your portfolio by customizing existing templates, or creating your own.
